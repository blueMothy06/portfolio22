  These words come from the Japanese proverb of “I hear no evil, I see no evil,

  in some cases, it justifies the deflection of responsibility to someone else.</p>

      An unintentional social anxiety simulator, this piece tells somewhat of a story through
      the randomly generated scenarios that pop up. Basically, you’re put into the shoes of
