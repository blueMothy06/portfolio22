  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>There are so many ways to tell a story. Writing, illustration, photography, film, dance...the list goes on. While the ways to express a story may be diverse in nature, the core of the story can remain the same throughout the mediums. If someone thinks they have a story that is eating them up from the inside that needs to be shown to the world, then they will do whatever they can to make it come to life. And to make artwork that lingers with people, whether in an “in your face” kind of obvious or the occasional fleeting memory, it takes a certain type of ambition and I am nothing short of foolishly ambitious.

  	Moreover, my work tells a story, whether it be through words, art, or simply experiences. My projects revolve around drawing in viewers into a world that is unlike their own. I love dark, almost Gothic atmospheres with a dash of surrealism, where the viewer may feel oppressed and uncomfortable in. My works are often complex, thanks to my love of piecing everything together—but not so much the pain of putting everything together—and I love having viewers who recognize that there are a lot of details and go through the entire piece carefully to uncover anything that they could find. It is satisfying to have my hard work pay off in that manner.
