  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I like to create artwork that lingers with people, whether in an “in your face” kind of obvious or “it comes back to you at strange times” kind of subtle. I am a writer at heart, so my dream is to reach people with my stories and have them resonate with the characters, plot, and themes. There are so many mediums that I am excited to try out and so many pros and cons of each; there is always bound to be something new I learn from each new project.

  Moreover, I tell a story with my work, whether with words, art, or simply experiences. My projects revolve around drawing in viewers into a world that is unlike their own. I love dark, almost Gothic atmospheres with a dash of surrealism, where the viewer may feel oppressed and uncomfortable in. My works are often complex, thanks to my love of piecing everything together—but not so much the pain of putting everything together—and I love having viewers who recognize that there are a lot of details and go through the entire piece carefully to uncover anything that they could find. It is satisfying to have my hard work pay off in that manner.
