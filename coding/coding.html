    <p><b>Glitch Art: February 2021</b>
  <br>
  These words come from the Japanese proverb of “I hear no evil, I see no evil,
  I speak no evil.” I interpret this as someone who is willfully ignorant and
  shuts away any information they deem as harmful. Ignorance may be bliss, but
  in some cases, it justifies the deflection of responsibility to someone else.</p>

    <b>Premise: </b>You have moved into your new house. Everything seems to be fine and dandy, until you realize that
    your neighbor won't stop staring at your window. No matter what you do, they will remain there.

      <b>Digital Self: March 2022</b>
      <br>
      Mouse Interaction
        <br>
        I chose this as my digital self since I love owls and the color orange.
        <br>
      When mouse is moving, the background will turn red and the body will turn black
      When mouse is clicked, the background changes to bright orange and the owl white.
      The size of the eyes is dependent on mic volume. <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/catherine.b.luong/full/fLy-U_E2k">Click me</a>!

      <b>Curated Data: March 2022</b>
      <br>
      An unintentional social anxiety simulator, this piece tells somewhat of a story through
      the randomly generated scenarios that pop up. Basically, you’re put into the shoes of
      this person who has done many things in their lifetime, but really does not want to be
      recognized right now. Also, noise warning. <a href="https://bluemothy06.github.io/random2/">Click me!</a>
